# addressBook

This a tiny version of an address-book developed. There is a of list
showing all the entries already made, a form to create new entries and edit existing ones and
the possibility to export the list into a XML-file. Each entry will consists of the fields (name,
first name, street, zip-code, and city) where the city is a drop down, with cities defined in
a table in the database. The design is a basic user-friendly.
